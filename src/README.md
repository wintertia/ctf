# Welcome

{% hint style="info" %}
**Welcome to my site! I'm usually known as `Wintertia (or Winter)`**
{% endhint %}

I'm a member of the Indonesian cyber security community, [**`Heroes Cyber Security (HCS)`**](https://hcs-team.com/). My main category of security is low level programming, which usually connects to **Binary Exploitation.**

This site will be used as my notes for all the **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions I've played in, especially in the **Binary Exploitation** category. There will be other categories as well depending on how important I think it is for myself to write it down.

Writeups are sorted by:

* Categories based on year
* The event time (from latest to oldest)
* The challenge solve time (from latest to oldest)
